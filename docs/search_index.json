CollaborationFests!, also known as CoFests! (and sometimes as “hackathons”), are collaborative work events where we expand and improve the AnVIL community and the AnVIL ecosystem. Sometimes these gatherings are focused on AnVIL, and sometimes they are part of larger communities. Modified from https://galaxyproject.org/events/cofests What’s in a name: CollaborationFests! and Hackathons We collaborate. AnVIL collaborative events are emphatically called CollaborationFests! rather than Hackathons. Putting Collaboration in the name emphasizes what the events are about for us, and Fest communicates that they are fun events (which they are). “Hackathon” implies an emphasis on code. CoFests! are about contributing and learning how to contribute to all aspects of AnVIL, including training material, community infrastructure, documentation, unit tests, bug reports, and yes, even code. First and foremost AnVIL CoFests! are about growing the community of future contributors. Idea inspiration from [GCC2024][GCC2018] Reporting inspiration from [BioC2018][BioC2020][BioC2023] AnVIL Collection Please check out our full collection of AnVIL and related resources: https://hutchdatascience.org/AnVIL_Collection/ "],["organizer-guide.html", "Organizer Guide CoFests! Goals Logistics Final Product / Report Out Example Schedule for a Track", " Organizer Guide The inaugural AnVIL Community Conference (ACC) 2024 will take place on November 12-13, 2024 in Cold Spring Harbor, NY, immediately before the sixth meeting on Biological Data Science. Overall, ACC is a key event for professionals in the genomics community interested in biomedical and genomic cloud computing and features keynotes, town halls, CoFests! and other such component events. CoFests! provide attendees the opportunity to get some hands-on experience with AnVIL and foster connections within the AnVIL community. CoFests! Goals Build an inclusive community that is supportive of newcomers Collaborate and contribute to open science Produce a final product that accomplishes one of the following for a topic Makes useful forward progress Identifies opportunities and boundaries or limitations Logistics 3 Parallel tracks, 5+ hours across Nov 12/13 Scalable Machine Learning and Data Science Polygenic Risk Score Analysis Wrap a Tool (+ Intro AnVIL/WDL) Scientific Lead and AnVIL Outreach coordinator for support We expect 4-10 participants per track Prior to the CoFests, the scientific lead and AnVIL Outreach coordinators will work together to enumerate some ideas for final products and post them publicly in this book. The AnVIL Outreach coordinator will help add content to this guide, onboard newer AnVIL users to the platform, and provide guidance on the final product / report out. Final Product / Report Out The final product of CoFests doesn’t need to be code! These Collaboration Fests can support story-boarding future work or development of documentation or training materials. If it’s something that will help the community and make progress on an AnVIL associated topic and there’s sufficient interest, the idea is game! As Galaxy phrased it for their CoFests: [The goal of collaboration fests is to expand the ecosystem] Not just the code, but the whole ecosystem. That includes training, tools, best practice workflows, documentation, test cases, translations, infrastructure, and yes, even code. It helps us a lot if you can fill out some basic Report Out details. At the end of Day 2, your track will share a final report during the CoFest Recap Session! Example Schedule for a Track Day 1 (2.5 hours) Task Time &amp; Lead Problem statement. Provide background info on the track’s overall topic and may include a brief summary of the pre-worked collaboration ideas. 20-30 minutes (Scientific Lead) Brainstorming. What project will the track tackle? Focus on understanding the participant backgrounds and skills and matching those with track ideas and actionable tasks to accomplish the goal. 15-30 minutes (Both) Onboarding. Handle billing accounts and other logistics necessary to accomplish the work. 30-60 minutes (AnVIL Outreach coordinator) Work-regroup, work-regroup. Formal collaboration work time left before dinner. (Groups may choose to work together informally after dinner too) 30-60 minutes (N/A) Day 2 (3 hours) Task Time &amp; Lead Work-regroup, work-regroup. Formal collaboration work time (with a coffee break). 2-2.5 hours (N/A) Construct a “report out”. The report out may be a Google doc, Google slides, a GitHub repository, a website, an OTTR book, etc. 30-60 minutes (AnVIL Outreach coordinator) "],["deploying-training-and-interpreting-deep-learning-models-for-regulatory-genomics-in-anvil.html", "Chapter 1 Deploying, Training, and Interpreting Deep Learning Models for regulatory genomics in AnVIL 1.1 About This Track 1.2 Report Out", " Chapter 1 Deploying, Training, and Interpreting Deep Learning Models for regulatory genomics in AnVIL Led by: Anshul Kundaje &amp; Vivek Ramalingam, Stanford University AnVIL Outreach coordinator: Kate Isaac 1.1 About This Track The “Deploying, Training, and Interpreting Deep Learning Models for Regulatory Genomics in AnVIL” CoFests! track at the AnVIL Community Conference offers hands-on training for users and developers interested in applying deep learning to regulatory genomics. This track aims to demonstrate how deep learning models can be utilized for functional genomics datasets, such as ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, at scale via AnVIL. Participants will develop a comprehensive understanding of the steps involved in deploying, training, and interpreting these models, including the available input options and how to leverage the resulting outputs to address various biological questions. 1.2 Report Out At the conclusion of the CoFest!, we will spend some time to collaboratively develop a user guide for utilizing these deep learning workspaces. This user guide will be published on GitHub.

No problem! Learn to wrap your pipelining tool in WDL and run it in an AnVIL workspace in this CoFest! session. We’ll go over WDL basics and how to run pipelines in AnVIL, then walk through how to run your own Unix/Python/R script. Along the way, you’ll write a WDL and build a custom Docker to run it with. Come and wrap a tool of interest! All experience levels are welcome. We’ll brainstorm and, if time allows, we’ll create resources (tutorials? AnVIL book? Cheat sheet?) for others to use to run their non-WDL tool in AnVIL. 3.2 Schedule 3.2.1 Tuesday Nov 12, 2024 (2.5 hours) Task Time Pipelining in AnVIL + WDLs presentation 2:15pm - 3:00pm Running a WDL and running Python script wrapped in WDL 3:00pm - 4:00pm Brainstorming AnVIL resources for wrapping other tools in WDL 4:00pm - 4:45pm 3.2.2 Wednesday Nov 13, 2024 (3 hours) Task Time Hackathon-like effort to develop ideas from brainstorming 1:00pm - 2:30pm Coffee break 2:30pm - 3:00pm Report Out 3:00pm - 4:00pm CoFest! recap 4:00pm "],["brainstorming-feature-requests-for-anvil.html", "Chapter 4 Brainstorming Feature Requests for AnVIL 4.1 About This Track 4.2 Report Out", " Chapter 4 Brainstorming Feature Requests for AnVIL Led by: Ava Hoffman, Fred Hutch Cancer Center / AnVIL Outreach 4.1 About This Track The “Brainstorming Feature Requests” CoFest track at the AnVIL Community Conference provides an opportunity for users and developers to directly communicate their needs to the AnVIL Outreach Team. Participants can share their experiences with the NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space (AnVIL), highlighting both its strengths and areas for improvement. The AnVIL Outreach team will facilitate discussion, gaining insights into real-world use cases and challenges. This open dialogue will help identify gaps in functionality and potential enhancements that could significantly improve the platform’s utility for genomic researchers. 4.2 Report Out By the end of the CoFest, the team will have compiled a Report Out list of feature requests based on user feedback, ensuring that future development efforts are aligned with the community’s needs. This collaborative approach will shape AnVIL’s future and strengthen connections between AnVIL developers and community members.
