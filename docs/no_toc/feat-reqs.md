# Brainstorming Feature Requests for AnVIL

Led by: Ava Hoffman, Fred Hutch Cancer Center / AnVIL Outreach

## About This Track

The "Brainstorming Feature Requests" CoFest track at the AnVIL Community Conference provides an opportunity for users and developers to directly communicate their needs to the AnVIL Outreach Team. Participants can share their experiences with the NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space (AnVIL), highlighting both its strengths and areas for improvement. 

The AnVIL Outreach team will facilitate discussion, gaining insights into real-world use cases and challenges. This open dialogue will help identify gaps in functionality and potential enhancements that could significantly improve the platform's utility for genomic researchers. 

## Report Out

By the end of the CoFest, the team will have compiled a [Report Out](https://jhudatascience.org/AnVIL_CoFests_2024/organizer-guide.html#final-product-report-out) list of feature requests based on user feedback, ensuring that future development efforts are aligned with the community's needs. This collaborative approach will shape AnVIL's future and strengthen connections between AnVIL developers and community members.
